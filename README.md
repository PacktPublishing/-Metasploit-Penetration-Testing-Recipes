# Metasploit Penetration Testing Recipes [Video]
This is the code repository for [Metasploit Penetration Testing Recipes [Video]]( https://www.packtpub.com/security/metasploit-penetration-testing-recipes-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
	
Metasploit is a Ruby-based platform for performing advanced penetration testing. It enables you to write, test, and execute exploit code. The Metasploit framework contains a suite of tools that you can use to test security vulnerabilities, enumerate networks, execute attacks, and evade detection.<br/><br/>
In this course, you'll go through some great recipes that will allow you to build on your existing Metasploit knowledge and start using it effectively. You'll improve your skills with some best practices and techniques and implement some troubleshooting issues you'll encounter using Metasploit. You'll learn to perform intelligence gathering, threat modeling, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and post-exploitation―all inside Metasploit.<br/><br/>
You'll learn to create and customize payloads to evade antivirus software, bypass an organization's defenses, exploit server vulnerabilities, attack client systems, compromise mobile phones, automate post exploitation, install backdoors, run keyloggers, highjack webcams, port public exploits to the Metasploit framework, create your own modules, and much more.<br/><br/>
By the end of this course, you'll be proficient with many tools and techniques and will have mastered everything you need to perform penetration testing using Metasploit and virtual machines.
